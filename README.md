### Hi there 👋🏼, I'm Soroush

I am graduated with bachelor's degree in computer engineering from the University of Guilan. While taking Advanced Programming course, I became familiar with the Java programming language and fell in love with it from the first lines of code I wrote. I quickly started to learn Java in depth and read many books on Java software development. At the end of that semester, when I gained highest grade in the class by developing the Bomber Man game as my final project, I was selected as teacher assistant for junior high students. Happily, I successfully assessed and supervised about 100 fellow students during my TAships. In my whole life I have never settled for less and always have tried to improve myself to achieve the best in anything and I never let anything to stop me from being ambitious. For all the time, i've been a person who wants to create great things and I have found this passion in developing great softwares.

I have strong skills in developing and maintaining Spring Boot programs. I’m fluent in Spring core and its futures. I am familiar with JPA and Spring Data and have the ability to work with a variety of relational and non-relational databases. I am familiar with the concepts of unit testing and have good experience in Junit framework. My specialties are Teamwork, Git, Linux, Java EE, Spring Boot, Clean Code and Java Design Pattern.
